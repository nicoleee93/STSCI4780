<p> I am an exchange student from China and this semester i will be study statistics in Cornell.

<p> My motivation of takeing BDA lies in a game theory problem i was asked in a interview. It is about playing games with a imaginary player who you don't know whether he is rational enough to make the best choice for both players or not. The game setting is that it's a binary game, and each player gives a number between 0 to 100 and if the sum don't exceeds 100 then each of the player wins the number he gives, otherwise both players receive 0.

<p> The decision I have to make is about whether i should make as money as i can from each game in reference to the other player's number in the previous round or stick to Nash Equilibrum of giving 50 which is the best outcome of both of us and it is sustainable. Using knowledge of posterior probability in Bayesian probability, i can calculate the probability of irrationality of the other player after each round. By setting a lower bound below which i should expect the other play to be overally irrationall and give up playing Nash Equilibrum and turn to make as much as money i can in the remaining game. The idea of Bayesian probability provides a more organzied method to play game like this, so it attracts me a lot to take the course and know more about BDA.
