    "## 2. Inference with the Cauchy distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab06 and Problem 1 the `UnivariateBayesianInference` base class was used to numerically compute results for inferences that we can handle analytically.  But this base class can also be used for problems that are not analytically tractable.  In this problem, you'll use it to do inference with data modeled with a **Cauchy distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cauchy distribution is a special case of the Student's $t$ distribution covered in Lec08; it corresponds to Student's $t$ with degrees of freedom parameter $\\nu=1$. It has an undefined mean and an infinite variance.  It is troublesome to work with in frequentist statistics.  Even it's maximum likelihood estimator has complicated sampling properties that pose not just computational challenges, but conceptual ones (the best frequentist methods require adopting something called the *conditional frequentist approach*, related to the likelihood principle).  In Bayesian inference, it poses no conceptual difficulties, but it must be handled numerically—which you'll do here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cauchy distribution is known in physics as the *Lorentzian distribution*, where in certain circumstances it describes the profile of spectral lines, and the distribution of particle mass peaks in accelerator experiments.  It also appears in problems where the ratio of two quantities with normal errors is of interest; when the quantities are uncorrelated with zero mean, the PDF for the ratio is a Cauchy distribution.  As noted above, the Student's $t$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom is a Cauchy distribution.  It also arises in geometric inference problems, as you will see in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find basic information about the Cauchy distribution [on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution) and in the [NIST Engineering Statistics Handbook](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3663.htm)."

A narrow sensor strip is on the barrier, oriented orthogonal to the rod (and not near either of its ends). The rod is at an unknown position, $x_0$, along the sensor.  The sensor records the locations of $N$ gamma rays emitted by the rod, denoted $x_i$ (for $i=1$ to $N$).  We'll assume that $d$ is small compared to the length of the sensor, so that the sensor may be considered essentially infinite in length.\n",

    "\n",
    "Means of one kind or another (e.g., arithmetic or weighted) are often used to estimate parameters from a sample of measurements modeled with IID sampling uncertainties.  The **central limit theorem** (CLT) provides a motivation for this.  It shows that, for large sample sizes $N$, and when the sampling distribution has a finite variance, the sample mean has a PDF that converges to a normal distribution with a standard deviation that, importantly, *shrinks with sample size* $\\propto 1/\\sqrt{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cauchy distribution does *not* have a finite variance; as a consequence, the CLT does not hold for the sample mean when the samples are from a Cauchy distribution.  Show this numerically:\n",

The CLT does not apply to the Cauchy distribution, so Cauchy distribution does not have a finite variance."
