But this base class can also be used for problems that are not analytically tractable.  In this problem, you'll use it to do inference with data modeled with a **Cauchy distribution**.\n",

    "The Cauchy distribution is a special case of the Student's $t$ distribution covered in Lec08; it corresponds to Student's $t$ with degrees of freedom parameter $\\nu=1$. It has an undefined mean and an infinite variance.  It is troublesome to work with in frequentist statistics.  Even it's maximum likelihood estimator has complicated sampling properties that pose not just computational challenges, but conceptual ones (the best frequentist methods require adopting something called the *conditional frequentist approach*, related to the likelihood principle).  In Bayesian inference, it poses no conceptual difficulties, but it must be handled numerically—which you'll do here.\n",

It also appears in problems where the ratio of two quantities with normal errors is of interest; when the quantities are uncorrelated with zero mean, the PDF for the ratio is a Cauchy distribution.  As noted above, the Student's $t$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom is a Cauchy distribution.  It also arises in geometric inference problems, as you will see in this problem.\n",

    "Means of one kind or another (e.g., arithmetic or weighted) are often used to estimate parameters from a sample of measurements modeled with IID sampling uncertainties.  The **central limit theorem** (CLT) provides a motivation for this.  It shows that, for large sample sizes $N$, and when the sampling distribution has a finite variance, the sample mean has a PDF that converges to a normal distribution with a standard deviation that, importantly, *shrinks with sample size* $\\propto 1/\\sqrt{N}$.\n",

    "> * Run your `cauchy_case` function many times (say, 1000, but use fewer for debugging!), with `plot=False`, collecting the posterior means and the sample means in separate arrays.  Use a largish sample size, say, $N=50$ or $100$.\n",
    "* Use matplotlib's `hist` function to plot histograms of the posterior means and sample means.  Use its `normed` parameter to plot the histograms normalized as piecewise-constant PDFs.  You can use the `alpha` (opacity) argument to make regions of overlap easier to discern.  Feel free to change the number of bins from the default value.\n",

    "But it is showm in the plot that the variance for one cauchy observation is close to sample means for 1000 observations, which clearly indicates that the standard deviation of sample means doesn't shrink with sample size. The CLT does not apply to the Cauchy distribution, so Cauchy distribution does not have a finite variance."
