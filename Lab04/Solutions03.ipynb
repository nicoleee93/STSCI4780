    "**Due:** Thursday, 2022-02-24, 11:59 PM, as a Jupyter notebook submitted via your repo in the course GitHub organization (see the detailed instructions in our LabResources repo).  Edit the provided Solutions03 notebook with your solutions.  All subproblems (or problems with no subproblems) are worth 1 point unless otherwise noted (grading will give fractional points as appropriate).   Be sure to include the required Python module alongside your solutions notebook in your repo.\n",

    "> Use the \"or\" and \"and\" rules to find an expression for $P(A\\lor B \\lor C)$, *not* assuming that $A$, $B$, and $C$ are mutually exclusive. Seek a result using only probabilities for the individual propositions, and \"and\" combinations of them. (You can use a comma instead of $\\land$ for \"and\" if you wish.)  You may use associativity of \"or\" and \"and;\" that is, $A\\lor (B \\lor C) \\equiv (A\\lor B) \\lor C$, and $A\\land (B \\land C) \\equiv (A\\land B) \\land C$.\n",

    "> Do this in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * Copy the following incomplete truth tables into your solution cell and complete them. For each table, you should find that the two \"starred\" columns (with a leading asterisk—that's not a logic symbol!) have the same truth values in every row, indicating they are logically equivalent. These tables thus establish two *rules of replacement*: where you see one of these formulas, you may substitute the other.  MathJax may make the headings hard to read, so to clarify: the first table aims to show $X\\land Y\\land X \\equiv X\\land Y$ (so you can drop repeated symbols in a multiple \"and\"), and the second table aims to show a kind of distributive rule: $X\\land (Y\\lor Z) \\equiv (X\\land Y)\\lor (X\\land Z)$.\n",

    "> *Hint*: You may find it easier to work on the tables using the [Markdown Tables generator - TablesGenerator.com](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) web page. Note that you can copy the Markdown for a table in a notebook to your clipboard, and load it into the web page using the `File->Paste...` command on the web page. Then you can revise it there, and copy the result back.\n",

So consider working in terms of the prior precision, $\\tau_0 \\equiv 1/w_0^2$, the precision for the likelihood function, $\\tau \\equiv 1/w^2$, and the posterior precision, $\\tilde{\\tau} \\equiv 1/\\tilde{w}^2$.

Strictly speaking, *the likelihood is not a PDF* (for $\\mu$), but since we usually only need the likelihood to be specified up to an arbitrary constant factor, it is computationally convenient to represent the likelihood with a PDF, so we can use SciPy's built-in functions to compute it.\n",
