    "In class we discussed three fundamental logical operations, the unary (operating on a single proposition) **NOT** (denial) operation, and the binary (operating on two propositions) **AND** (conjuction) and **OR** (disjunction) operations.  For propositions $A$ and $B$, with 0 denoting *False* and 1 denoting *True*, the following truth tables describe these operations (I've separated inputs from outputs with an empty column; note that the notebook's table renderer may split headers like \"$A\\land B$\", etc., across a line):\n",
    "\n",
    "| A |   |  NOT A |\n",

    "| 1   | 1   |   | 1           | 1          |\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are other useful truth-functional operations (unary, binary, and higher order).  For example, **OR** is defined to correspond to *inclusive* \"or\" in English, but we could also define an *exclusive* \"or\" operation (\"either $A$ is true or $B$ is true, but not both\"), denoted by $\\veebar$ and called **XOR**, according to the following truth table:\n",

    "| 1   | 1   |   | 0             |\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, propositional logic uses a *material implication* operator, denoted by $\\Rightarrow$, to capture the weakest meaning of statements like \"if $A$ is true, then $B$ must be,\" with this truth table:\n",

    "| 1   | 1   |   | 1                 |\n",
    "\n",
    "$A \\Rightarrow B$ captures a weak interpretation of \"if... then...\" in the sense that it is false to claim $A \\Rightarrow B$ *only* if $A$ is true when $B$ is false; in all other cases the implication is considered true.  Don't puzzle too much over the meaning of material implication; here it's just meant to be another example of a binary operation."

    "Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky did groundbreaking work on the psychology of judgment and decision-making in the 1970s; Kahneman won the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for this work (Tversky died in 1996 and thus could not share the prize).  They performed numerous ingenious survey-based experiments designed to uncover the heuristics people use to reason amidst uncertainty.  One of their most famous experiments featured the following problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A cab was involved in a hit and run accident at night. Two cab companies, the Green and the Blue, operate in the city. The following facts are known:\n",
    "\n",
    "> * 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue.\n",
    "> * A witness identified the cab as Blue.\n",
    "> * The court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the probability that the cab involved in the accident was actually Blue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kahneman and Tversky found that the typical answer was around 80%.  They used this finding (among many others) to show that humans reason using *heuristics*, mental shortcuts that may give a usable result or decision quickly in some circumstances, but not always the *correct* or *optimal* answer.  For this cab problem, the evidence for use of heuristics came from realizing that the typical answer is *wrong*, i.e., that most people do not reason correctly in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Aside:*** If these ideas intrigue you, have a look at Kahneman's widely-cited 2011 book on this research, [*Thinking, Fast and Slow*](https://us.macmillan.com/thinkingfastandslow/danielkahneman/9780374533557/). The title refers to their idea that the brain has evolved to use two systems for reasoning, a *fast* system that uses imperfect heuristics, and a *slow* (and resource-intensive) system that is capable of careful, sound reasoning. For brief overviews, see [philosopher Jim Holt's review in the *New York Times*](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/books/review/thinking-fast-and-slow-by-daniel-kahneman-book-review.html) for a slightly critical overview, or [Wikipedia's summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow)."
