    "* In the notebook, write a function `plot_bvn_rho_cond(rho, x)` that plots a standard BVN distribution with correlation coefficient `rho`, the same way the `plot_bvn_rho` function in the `BVNDemo` notebook does.  In addition, it should plot a vertical line on the plot at `x`, and, in a separate set of axes, plot the conditional PDF for $y$ given $x$ with the specified `x` value.\n",
    "There is more than one good way to do this, and depending on how you implement it, you may condition on $y$ instead of $x$ if that makes your plot look better.\n",

You may have your function generate the plot from scratch, or take axes as input (as the `plot_bvn` function does). Eliminate any unnecessary code from `plot_bvn` (e.g., plotting regressioin lines). Your function should be *simpler* than `plot_bvn`, except for the part computing the PDF values and the contour levels."
